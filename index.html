                    <p>I graduated from Metropolitan State University early in 2018. After graduating, I worked as a psyche associate for two years. I currently work as a Behavioral therapist. I always had an interest in coding but never took the time to learn.</p>
                    <p> After two years of working as a behavioral therapist, I decided to learn how to code and hopefully change careers. I like the challenge of solving problems; the idea of creating something is fascinating. I welcome all the challenges ahead of me, and I hope to gain a lot from this journey. At thinkful, I hope to achieve the right skills and become a developer.</p>
